Perfect! Here's a **focused roadmap (Steps 1 to 5)** tailored just for you to follow in order:

---

### ðŸ”¶ **STEP 1: Deepen Your OOP Understanding (in JavaScript)**

#### Goals:

* Master class-based OOP
* Write clean modular code
* Understand real-world use cases

#### Key Topics:

* Classes & Objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance vs Composition
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction (simulate using interfaces in JS)
* Access modifiers (public/private in ES6+)
* Static methods & properties

#### What to do:

* Build small examples like `Shape`, `Vehicle`, `Account`, etc.
* Convert functional code to OOP style
* Simulate interfaces using `duck typing`

#### Resources:

* [MDN OOP in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)
* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) (for deep JS concepts)

### ðŸ”¶ **STEP 2: Learn SOLID Principles**

| Principle | Description           | JS Example                                         |
| --------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**     | Single Responsibility | A class should have one reason to change           |
| **O**     | Open/Closed           | Open for extension, closed for modification        |
| **L**     | Liskov Substitution   | Subclasses should replace parents without breakage |
| **I**     | Interface Segregation | Split large interfaces into smaller ones           |
| **D**     | Dependency Inversion  | Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes       |

#### What to do:

* Take one principle per day/week and apply it to small examples
* Refactor existing code to apply these principles

### ðŸ”¶ **STEP 3: Study Common Design Patterns (only key ones for now)**

Start with **3 types** and 2 patterns from each:

#### Creational:

* Singleton
* Factory Method

#### Structural:

* Adapter
* Decorator

#### Behavioral:

* Strategy
* Observer

#### What to do:

* Learn the intent of each pattern
* Build a basic use case (e.g., logger using Singleton, UI plugin using Decorator)
* Try rewriting them in JS

#### Resource:

* [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
* Book: *Head First Design Patterns (read selectively)*

---

### ðŸ”¶ **STEP 4: Learn UML & Class Diagrams**

You donâ€™t need to be perfectâ€”just enough to communicate your design.

#### Learn:

* Class diagram basics (classes, attributes, methods)
* Relationships:

  * Inheritance (`ðŸ¡’`)
  * Aggregation vs Composition
* Sequence diagrams (optional, if you feel curious)

#### Tools:

* [Draw.io](https://draw.io)
* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com)

#### What to do:

* Pick a basic system (like `Parking Lot`) and draw class diagrams manually
* Start every new design with a rough sketch of classes

---

### ðŸ”¶ **STEP 5: Solve LLD Problem Statements**

Start applying what youâ€™ve learned:

#### Beginner-friendly systems:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
2. **Parking Lot System**
3. **Library Management System**
4. **Vending Machine**
5. **Snake & Ladder**
6. **ATM Machine**

#### What to do:

* Write class diagrams first
* Identify classes, responsibilities, relationships
* Think about edge cases and extensibility
* Implement using JS OOP style

#### Resources:

* YouTube: [CodeKarle LLD Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeKarle)
* Gaurav Senâ€™s LLD discussions (for advanced perspective)

---

### âœ… Bonus Tip: Make a GitHub LLD Repo

* Store each design problem as a separate folder with:

  * JS code
  * UML/Class diagram (as an image)
  * Short README explaining your approach
